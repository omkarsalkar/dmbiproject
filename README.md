HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION

This system focus on predicting the house prices usingvarious factors(attributes) mentioned in the database.
We will understand the problem of a real estate company from it and then apply ML to solve it. In his project I will be walking you through finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and applying algorithms like 
1)Linear Regression
2)Decision Tree Regression
3)Random Forest Regression

At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. also cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.
